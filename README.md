# PHP File Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP file handling: insufficient error checking when opening a file.  The provided code attempts to open a file, but it fails silently if the file cannot be opened.  A proper solution should provide more informative error messages and handle potential issues gracefully.

## Bug

The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code.  It attempts to open a file but lacks proper error handling. If the file does not exist or there are permission issues, the script will silently fail. This can lead to unexpected behavior and debugging difficulties.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version.  It includes comprehensive error checking using `error_get_last()` and detailed error messages that assist in identifying the issue.
